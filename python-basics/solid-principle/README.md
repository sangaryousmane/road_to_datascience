# SOLID PRINCIPLE

# But what are these SOLID principles? SOLID is an acronym that groups five core principles that apply to object-oriented design. These principles are the following:

- Single-responsibility principle (SRP)
- Open–closed principle (OCP)
- Liskov substitution principle (LSP)
- Interface segregation principle (ISP)
- Dependency inversion principle (DIP)


# Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP)
The single-responsibility principle (SRP) comes from Robert C. 
Martin, more commonly known by his nickname Uncle Bob, who’s a well-respected figure in the software engineering world and one of the original signatories of the Agile Manifesto. 
In fact, he coined the term SOLID.

# The single-responsibility principle states that:
A class should have only one reason to change.
This means that a class should have only one responsibility, as expressed through its methods. 
If a class takes care of more than one task, then you should separate those tasks into separate classes.

This principle is closely related to the concept of separation of concerns, which suggests that you should split your programs into different sections. Each section must address a separate concern.
